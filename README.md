# GD-Link
This is the MATLAB code for GD-Link.

This example is executed in the data set Facebook-Twitter. There are 3600 link pairs cross two platform, and the original data has been preprocessed to user feature vector.

Because CVX or MOSEK optimization method as mentioned in the paper is related to the third-party software, the gradient descent is used as optimization method in this version. More optimization algorithms will be available in following versions.
